    <p class="normal">Function definitions are a way to decompose a large problem into smaller problems. Mathematicians have been doing this for centuries. It’s a way to package our Python programming into intellectually manageable chunks.</p>

    <p class="normal">We’ll look at a number of function definition techniques in these recipes. This will include ways to handle flexible parameters and ways to organize the parameters based on some higher-level design principles.</p>

    <p class="normal">We’ll also look at the <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span class="cmtt-10x-x-109">typing</span></span></span> module and how we can create more formal type hints for our functions. Using type hints will prepare our code so we can use tools like <span class="cmbx-10x-x-109">mypy </span>to confirm the data types are used properly throughout a program. Type hints aren’t required, but they often identify potential inconsistencies, ...</p></section></div>
