    <p class="normal">The idea of <span class="cmbx-10x-x-109">functional programming </span>is to focus on writing small, expressive functions that perform the required data transformations. Combinations of functions can often create code that is more succinct and expressive than long strings of procedural statements or the methods of complex, stateful objects. This chapter focuses on functional programming features of Python more than procedural or object-oriented programming.</p>

    <p class="normal">This provides an avenue for software design distinct from the strictly object-oriented approach used elsewhere in this book. The combination of objects with functions permits flexibility in assembling an optimal collection of components.</p>
